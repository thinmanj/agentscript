# AgentScript is a declarative language for agentic program creation.
# The generated code follows a specific structure to maintain clarity:
#
# - Each AgentScript 'intent' becomes a Python class
# - Pipeline operations are converted to sequential pandas operations
# - Error handling is built-in with validation_errors tracking
# - Methods are well-documented with their original intent descriptions
#
# For debugging: Line numbers in comments refer to the original .ags file

# Required imports for data processing
import csv
import pandas as pd

        Simple data processor

        This class was generated from an AgentScript 'intent' declaration.
        An intent represents a high-level data processing goal that gets
        transpiled into a sequence of pandas operations.

        Structure:
        - __init__: Initializes error tracking and validation patterns
        - simple_processor: Main processing method implementing the pipeline
        - Helper methods: Utility functions for validation and transformation

        The validation_errors list collects any data validation issues
        encountered during processing for debugging and quality assurance.
